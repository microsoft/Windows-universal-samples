            Next, you need the "other side of the connection" -- you need to connect to a listener.
            The host name and service name (often a port number) to connect to are the "Host
            Name:" and "Service Name:" entries. The service name should match what you started
            to listen to!
        </p>
        <p>
            The connection will automatically use IPv6 as needed. It will also resolve internationalized
            domain names.
        </p>
        <p>
            Due to the network security system, you cannot connect to other applications running
            on the same machine. This means that you can only use "localhost" to connect to
            the same application (specifically, you can connect to a listener on the same machine
            running in the same app container)
        </p>
        <p> 
            If an adapter was selected in the previous step, connect will also attempt to limit traffic to the selected adapter.
