# POS Printer Sample

This sample demonstrates the use of the [**Windows.Devices.PointOfService.PosPrinter**](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn298071) API.

Specifically, this sample shows how to:

1.  **Receipt printer basic operation**

    This scenario demonstrates how to find, claim, and enable a receipt printer and then allows the user to print a line or a sample receipt.

2.  **Receipt printer error handling**

    This scenario demonstrates how to check for error conditions during basic printer operation, and reports any errors to the user.

3.  **Multiple instances of receipt printers**

    This scenario demonstrates the claim/release model used by the POS Printer API by allowing the user to manager two printer instances with UI controls for claiming, retaining, and releasing the printer objects.

**Note** The Windows universal samples require Visual Studio 2015 to build and Windows 10 to execute.
