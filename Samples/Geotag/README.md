# Geotag sample

Shows how to use the GeotagHelper class to read geotag information from a file and set a file's geotag information to a specific location
or to a location obtained from a Geolocator.

> If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, you can download the entire collection as a 
> [ZIP file](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/archive/master.zip), but be 
> sure to unzip everything to access shared dependencies. For more info on working with the ZIP file, 
> the samples collection, and GitHub, see [Get the UWP samples from GitHub](https://aka.ms/ovu2uq).
