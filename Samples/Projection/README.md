# Projection sample

Shows how to display two different views of your app UI on different screens, as users might do when projecting your app in a meeting or conference.

> **Note:** This sample is part of a large collection of UWP feature samples. 
> If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, you can download the entire collection as a 
> [ZIP file](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/archive/master.zip), but be 
> sure to unzip everything to access shared dependencies. For more info on working with the ZIP file, 
> the samples collection, and GitHub, see [Get the UWP samples from GitHub](https://aka.ms/ovu2uq). 
> For more samples, see the [Samples portal](https://aka.ms/winsamples) on the Windows Dev Center. 

The sample demonstrates:

-  Displaying two different views of your app on different screens.
-  Starting, stopping and swapping views.
-  Using [ProjectionManager](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn281126) and [ApplicationViewSwitcher](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn281094) APIs.
-  Enumerating available screens to project to and projecting a view of your app to a specific one.
