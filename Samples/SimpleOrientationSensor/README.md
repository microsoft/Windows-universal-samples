# Simple Orientation Sensor sample

This sample demonstrates the use of the Windows.Devices.Sensors.SimpleOrientationSensor API for a simple device orientation sensor.

This sample allows the user to view the orientation values that reflect the simple device orientation (e.g. not rotated, face up, rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise). You can choose one of two scenarios:

-   Orientation sensor data events
-   Polling orientation sensor readings

**Simple Orientation Sensor Data Events**

When you choose the Enable button for the **Data Events** option, the app will begin displaying sensor readings in real time.

**Polling Simple Orientation Sensor Readings**

When you choose the Enable button for the **Polling** option, the app will retrieve the current sensor readings.

## System requirements

**Client:** Windows 10

**Server:** Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview

**Phone:** Windows 10

## Build the sample

1. Start Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 and select **File** \> **Open** \> **Project/Solution**.
