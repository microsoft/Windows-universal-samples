# Title bar sample

Shows various ways of customizing the title bar.

> **Note:** This sample is part of a large collection of UWP feature samples. 
> If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, you can download the entire collection as a 
> [ZIP file](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/archive/master.zip), but be 
> sure to unzip everything to access shared dependencies. For more info on working with the ZIP file, 
> the samples collection, and GitHub, see [Get the UWP samples from GitHub](https://aka.ms/ovu2uq). 
> For more samples, see the [Samples portal](https://aka.ms/winsamples) on the Windows Dev Center. 

The sample shows the following techniques:

- Customizing the colors in the standard system title bar.
- Extending the view into the title bar, so you can draw a custom title bar.
- Responding to changes in title bar states.
- Drawing controls in the title bar (XAML only).

**Note** The Windows universal samples require Visual Studio 2015 to build and Windows 10 to execute.

**Note** Not all of the title bar functionality is available in all builds. Functionality will arrive gradually as newer builds are released.

To obtain information about Windows 10 development, go to the [Windows Dev Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=532421)

To obtain information about Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 and the tools for developing Windows apps, go to [Visual Studio 2015](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=532422)
