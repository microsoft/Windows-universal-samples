# Phone call sample

This sample shows how to use the [**Calls**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.applicationmodel.calls.aspx) APIs. This sample does not follow the typical sample template pattern, it is a sample app that uses the MWC pattern to give you a working E2E phone call application to start with. 

NOTE: This is a mobile only sample.

This sample allows the user to:

-   Query phone line information
-   Query phone call status
-   Query voice mail information
-   Place phone calls (Single and Multi-SIM)

The app UI represents the following tabs:

### Status tab

This focuses on accessing basic phone line information.

### Contacts tab

This focuses on contacts integration with your own phone call app.

### Dialer tab

This is a dialer that allows users to place a phone call.

### Voice mail tab

This focuses on accessing voice mail information and placing calls to the user's voice mail.
