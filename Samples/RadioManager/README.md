## Build the sample

2. Start Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 and select **File** \> **Open** \> **Project/Solution**.
3. Starting in the folder where you unzipped the samples, go to the Samples subfolder, then the subfolder for this specific sample, then the subfolder for your preferred language (C++, C#, or JavaScript). Double-click the Visual Studio 2015 Solution (.sln) file.
4. Press Ctrl+Shift+B, or select **Build** \> **Build Solution**.

## Run the sample

The next steps depend on whether you just want to deploy the sample or you want to both deploy and run it.

### Deploying the sample

- Select **Build** \> **Deploy Solution**. 

### Deploying and running the sample

- To debug the sample and then run it, press F5 or use **Debug** \> **Start Debugging**. To run the sample without debugging, press Ctrl+F5 or use **Debug** \> **Start Without Debugging**.
